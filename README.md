# Tight Model Format
Tight model format is a model format focused on packing model data as tightly as possible, reducing model file sizes. While used model compression is lossy, quality of compression can be easily set, and default settings try to preserve such level of detail, that compressed and not compressed models can't be distinguished by a human eye.
# How is data compressed and stored inside a TMF file?
Overview of the compression methods and data storage process is described in depth in TMF specification in file TMF_SPEC.md
